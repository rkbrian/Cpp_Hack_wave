# Hack Week in C++
Design and develop a C++ application for the theme: Waves

### Design Purpose:
This application is an educational tool for the study of sine wave graphs in trigonometry and physics. It takes input parameters and print the graph in ascii art.

### Compile and Usage
make all - compile to make the appliaction "sinewave"\
./sinewave

### Flowchart:
